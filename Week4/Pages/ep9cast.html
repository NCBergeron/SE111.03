                            into a galaxy-spanning conflict. Despite dismissing herself as 'no one,' she 
                            learns that her life is being shaped by the mysterious power of the Force.</p>

                            the memory of his father and the bond he shared Rey, Ben Solo found his way 
                            back to the light and renounced the dark persona of Kylo Ren. After the 
                            Emperor's destruction during the Battle of Exegol, Solo sacrificed his life 
                            to save Rey, ultimately becoming one with the Force like his grandfather, 
                            uncle, and mother before him. Solo's death marked the end of the Skywalker 
                            bloodline, but his sacrifice ensured the survival of their legacy through 
                            Rey, who took the name Skywalker.</p>
