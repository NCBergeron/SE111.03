                <p><b>Nathan Bergeron</b><i> October 21, 2025</i></p>
                <p>Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens, is a mixed bag of opinions. It should have 
                    been a bit more unique like the other movies insteadly of having an uncanny amount of 
                    parallels to A New Hope. The cinematography and effects were great but the writing 
                    lacked originality. 
                </p>
                <p>My favorite actor in this movie was Oscar Isaac who played the pilot Poe Dameron. Oscar 
                    made Poe feel like a real person who people could relate to and who wasn't an overly 
                    gifted person.

                <h2>A few fun facts</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Production was extremely secret and actors auditioning had no idea what they were auditioning for</li>
                    <li>Lots of celebrities played secret cameo roles that wouldn't take away from the movie (like stormtroopers)</li>
                    <li>Harrison Fords leg got crushed and broken by a hydraulic door</li>
                </ul>
