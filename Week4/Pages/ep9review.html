                <p><b>Nathan Bergeron</b><i> October 21, 2025</i></p>
                <p>Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker, is in my opinion the best star wars movie 
                    out of the sequels. I like it because I recognize it as an attempt to salvage the writing 
                    nightmare that the sequels are. Ignoring the writing, the visuals are good and it can be 
                    an enjoyable watch.
                </p>
                <p>My favorite actor in this movie is Adam Driver. He did a nice job portraying someone 
                    coming back to the light after being in the dark for a long time.
