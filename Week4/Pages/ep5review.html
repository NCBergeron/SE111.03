                <p><b>Nathan Bergeron</b><i> October 21, 2025</i></p>
                <p>Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back, is regarded as the most popular of the original 
                    trilogy and I believe this is because this is because this is the movie where we can see the 
                    universe of star wars really expand and become what it is today.
                </p>
                <p>My favorite actor in this movie is Harrison Ford, his line delivery is deliberate and adds a certain 
                    flair that only he could bring to the character Han Solo.
                </p>
