                        <p>Discovered as a slave on Tatooine by Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker had
                            the potential to become one of the most powerful Jedi ever.
                            Some even believed he was the prophesied Chosen One who would bring balance to the Force.
                            Always pushing the limits of his Jedi training, seeking to excel and live up to his
                            reputation,
                            Skywalker's passion often brought him into conflict with his mentor, Jedi Master Obi-Wan
                            Kenobi. A hero of the Clone Wars, Anakin was caring and compassionate,
                            but suffered from a deep fear of loss that would prove to be his downfall.</p>

                        <p>After the Supreme Chancellor was kidnapped by General Grievous, leader of the droid army,
                            Obi-Wan and Anakin led a daring rescue mission. They battled their way to Grievous' ship,
                            and gained entrance to the control tower where they once again dueled Count Dooku.
                            While Dooku was able to defeat Obi-Wan, nearly killing him, he could not best Anakin.
                            At the urging of Chancellor Palpatine, the young Jedi beheaded the Sith Lord.
                            Anakin carried an unconscious Obi-Wan on his back, and the three returned to Coruscant.</p>

                        <p>The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural,
                            and Sheev Palpatine is the most infamous follower of its doctrines. Scheming, powerful,
                            and evil to the core, Darth Sidious restored the Sith and destroyed the Jedi Order.
                            Living a double life, he was also Palpatine, a Naboo Senator and phantom menace.
                            He manipulated the political system of the Galactic Republic until he was named Supreme
                            Chancellor -- and eventually Emperor - and ruled the galaxy through fear and tyranny.</p>
