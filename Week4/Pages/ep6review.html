                <p><b>Nathan Bergeron</b><i> October 21, 2025</i></p>
                <p>Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, is in my personal opinion the best movie in the original 
                    trilogy. The story is all tied together and the conflict resolution is satisfying and not rushed. The 
                    worlds are interesting and there is a steady pace in the story.
                </p>
                <p>My favorite actor in this movie is Mark Hamill. Continuing his legacy of playing Luke Skywalker he's 
                    visually grown to understand the character inside and out and does not disappoint in his acting.
                </p>
