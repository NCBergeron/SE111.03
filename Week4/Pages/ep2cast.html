                            apprentice who is assigned to protect Padmé with whom he falls in love. He is believed to 
                            be the "chosen one" of Jedi prophecy destined "to bring balance to The Force." In the 10 
                            years since The Phantom Menace, he has grown powerful but arrogant, and believes that 
                            Obi-Wan is holding him back.</p>

                        <p>As Obi-Wan Kenobi continued to train Anakin Skywalker, the two were assigned as security for their 
                            old friend, Senator Padmé Amidala, after an assassination attempt on her life. After a second attempt, 
                            Obi-Wan and Anakin pursued her attacker, a clawdite bounty hunter named Zam Wesell. Following her 
                            into one of Coruscant's seedy bars, Obi-Wan waited until Wesell approached him and severed her hand 
                            with a surprise cut from his lightsaber. The Jedi carried the wounded bounty hunter out into the 
                            street, where Wesell was mysteriously killed by a poison dart shot from above. Obi-Wan began an 
                            investigation, finding that the dart was from the planet Kamino -- a world which had been mysteriously 
                            erased from the Jedi Archives. On Kamino he discovered that a massive clone army had been created for 
                            the Republic -- in the name of a Jedi who had been dead for nearly 10 years -- and the genetic blueprint 
                            was bounty hunter Jango Fett. Looking to secure Jango, Kenobi battled Fett in the planet's never-ending 
                            rain, with the bounty hunter escaping in his starship. Obi-Wan tracked Fett to Geonosis, where he found 
                            Separatist forces had gathered under the leadership of former Jedi Count Dooku. While reporting back to 
                            the Jedi, Obi-Wan was ambushed, taken prisoner, and sentenced to die in the Geonosis arena. He survived, 
                            killing a vicious acklay, and alongside other Jedi and the new clone army, fought off battle droids as 
                            the Clone War erupted around him. He and Anakin then engaged Count Dooku, who had turned to the dark side. 
                            Both Jedi suffered injuries in their failure to stop the Separatist leader.</p>
