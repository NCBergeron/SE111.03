                        <p>A venerable if maverick Jedi Master, Qui-Gon Jinn was a student of the living Force. 
                            Qui-Gon lived for the moment, espousing a philosophy of "feel, don't think -- use 
                            your instincts." On Tatooine, Qui-Gon discovered a young slave boy named Anakin 
                            Skywalker who was strong in the Force. Sensing the boy's potential, Qui-Gon liberated 
                            Anakin from slavery.</p>

                            to enter the even murkier waters of Coruscant politics, becoming a representative for his

                        <p>Padm√© was identified early for her potential in public service. Devoting her life to 
                            civic duty, she was elected queen and, therefore, adopted the regnal name "Amidala" 
                            in 32 BBY. Due to the machinations of her advisor, Senator Sheev Palpatine, Amidala's 
                            reign was put to the test by the Trade Federation's blockade and subsequent invasion 
                            of Naboo.</p>
